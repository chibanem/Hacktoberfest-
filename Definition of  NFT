Description
An NFT is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, which can be sold and traded. The NFT can be associated with a particular
digital or physical asset (such as a file or a physical object) and a license to use the asset for a specified purpose.[3] NFTs (and the associated 
license to use, copy or display the underlying asset) can be traded and sold on digital markets.[4]

NFTs function like cryptographic tokens, but, unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, NFTs are not mutually interchangeable, hence not fungible. 
While all bitcoins are equal, each NFT may represent a different underlying asset and thus have a different value.[5] NFTs are created when blockchains
string records of cryptographic hash, a set of characters identifying a set of data, onto previous records therefore creating a chain of identifiable 
data blocks.[6] This cryptographic transaction process ensures the authentication of each digital file by providing a digital signature that is used to
track NFT ownership.[6] However, data links that point to details like where the art is stored can die.[7]
